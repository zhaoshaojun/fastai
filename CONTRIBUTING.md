# How to contribute to fastai

First, thanks a lot for wanting to help! Make sure you have read the [doc on code style](
https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/docs-dev/style.md) first. (Note that we don't follow PEP8, but instead follow a coding style designed specifically for numerical and interactive programming.) For help running and building the code, see the [developers guide](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/docs-dev/develop.md).

## Did you find a bug?

* Nobody is perfect, especially not us. But first, please double-check the bug doesn't come from something on your side. The [forum](http://forums.fast.ai/) is a tremendous source for help, and we'd advise to use it as a first step. Be sure to include as much code as you can so that other people can easily help you.
* Then, ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
* Be sure to add the complete error messages.

#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/fastai/fastai).
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Before submitting, please be sure you abide by our [coding style](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/docs-dev/style.md) and [the guide on abbreviations](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/docs-dev/abbr.md) and clean-up your code accordingly.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* You can suggest your change on the [fastai forum](http://forums.fast.ai/) to see if others are interested or want to help. [This topic](http://forums.fast.ai/t/fastai-v1-adding-features/23041/8) lists the features that will be added to fastai in the foreseeable future. Be sure to read it too!
* PRs are welcome with a complete description of the new feature and an example of how it's use. Be sure to document your code and read the [doc on code style](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/docs-dev/style.md) and [the one on abbreviations](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/docs-dev/abbr.md).

## Do you have questions about the source code?

* Please ask it on the [fastai forum](http://forums.fast.ai/) (after searching someone didn't ask the same one before with a quick search). We'd rather have the maximum of discussions there so that the largest number can benefit from it.

## Do you want to contribute to the documentation?

* Head over to the [fastai_docs](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_docs) repo
