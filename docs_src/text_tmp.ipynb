       "    <th>this is one of my all - time favorite films , and while it may move too slowly for some , it 's well worth seeing . a corporate lawyer ( richard xxunk ) is dragged into a case involving \" city \" aborigines , and this is no ordinary case . ok , a man has died but it was n't exactly a normal killing . there has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately , and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic & xxunk . the aborigines are xxunk a secret and refuse to xxunk the xxunk . this has a lot to do with white men making xxunk about \" city \" vs. \" xxunk \" aborigines , and of course no xxunk in the big city would practice xxunk ways . xxunk huh . xxunk is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what 's happening , although no matter how many times i 've seen this i ca n't quite grasp the exact connection . this is a very eerie and creepy film , and is a fine example of peter xxunk 's ability to create tension out of nothing . the ending is a little xxunk but i take it literally , it 's the xxunk way out and the scariest . 10 out of 10 and highly recommended .</th>\n",
