# Note from Shaojun
For the original readme, please refer to the fastai repo.

If you have a Mac, and want to learn the fastai **ML course** in 2020, this repo is for you!

# Why this repo
Much of the fastai ML course is a little outdated. I have made minimal chances in the old/fastai directory to remove unnecessary dependencies. If you are curious, you may find the changes in the git history.

# How to install
Make sure you have python 3.6 and scikit-learn 0.22. After that, just git clone this repo, and install dependecies when you found they are missing. You do not have to install fastai.

# Note to myself
1. part 1: 
..1. random forests. See video lesson 1 to video lesson 7.
2. part 2: 
..2. neural networks. See video lession 8 to video lesson 12.
