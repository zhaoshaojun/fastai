## Current Status

This is pre-pre-alpha. Stuff is moving around and changing every day. You should only be using this if you're interested in digging into the details and actively contributing to the project.

First, clone fastai using `git`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai.git
```
Then, `cd` to the fastai folder and create the python environment:

```sh
cd fastai
conda env update
```
This downloads all of the dependencies and then all you have to do is:

```sh
source activate fastai
```

To update everything:

```sh
git pull
conda env update
```
