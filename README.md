# Note from Shaojun

For the original readme, please refer to the fastai repo.

If you have a Mac, and want to learn the fastai ML course in 2020, this repo is for you!

# How to install
Make sure you have python 3.6 and scikit-learn 0.22. After that, just git clone this repo, and install dependecies when you found they are missing. You do not have to install fastai.

I have chanced the fastai code (under old/fastai) and removed unnecessary dependencies.
